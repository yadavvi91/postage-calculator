Here is the [initial git repo in C#](https://github.com/bnathyuw/Complex-Refactoring-In-Simple-Steps)

I have used Approvals Test over here.

The CalculatorTest isn't great. I tried to follow both parameterized tests and approvals test and they don't seem to work well together.

The workaround is from the suggestion from Llewellyn Flaco's video - https://youtu.be/8OxH9Lz0Ckg?t=1228

Still pretty bad though.

Another resource I found pretty handy (again from suggestion from one of Llewellyn Falco's videos - https://youtu.be/wp6oSVDdbXQ?t=1146) is the refactoring recipes-
